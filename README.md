# Blog

A simple blog using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for technical tidbits about Animal Society.

## Usage

This repo uses `git submodules`, so after cloning one must also issue the following command:

```
git submodule update --init --progress
```

Then run `hugo server -D` and start making posts. Push to `master` for publishing.
